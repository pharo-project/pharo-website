Tomohiro from Software Research Associates, Inc.![](http://files.pharo.org/success-stories/images/HoneyGinger-LagoonRefractionWorld.png width=600px)Like other SPH \(Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics\) based simulators, HoneyGinger computes motions of particles by approximated Navier-Stokes equations.Other than simply drawing dots for particle positions, HoneyGinger renders grids of velocity vectors, borderlines of pressure, pressure maps, refracted images that approximate the refraction of rays on the surface, Voronoi/Delaunay tessellations and stipple by finer dots. It is also possible for the users to intervene in the simulation by placing obstacles, sources, and drains of particles using mice and keyboards.HoneyGinger is open-sourced at GitHub \(https://github.com/tomooda/HoneyGinger\) with demo movies.
