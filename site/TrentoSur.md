_ "The experience with Pharo exceeded our own expectations. During the
sales phase we were able to prototype a working version of the product
while our competition was still sketching PowerPoint presentations.
Once we went into production the servers ran uninterruptedly for
months, without a single glitch nor downtime." - Esteban A. Maringolo
