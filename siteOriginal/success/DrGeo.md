It is distributed with its source code that you can modify while using it. Dr. Geo XO bundle was downloaded more than 180'000 times! And DrGeo won [several prizes](http://www.drgeo.eu/community).Ten years old kids use Dr. Geo to explore Euclidean geometric sketch, agile kids extend and program it with its embedded dynamic language and user interface.![](file:///web/files/success/2014-06-DrGeo-modifyMe.png width=800px)What sets Dr.Geo apart from the other geometry software is the possibility of studying and even modifying/extending its source code while s/he is using it to create a figure. All in all, its philosophy is also to empower the user with direct access to the Dr. Geo arcane and programming. For example, with script, one can build a geometric sketch to compute the slope at an arbitrary location of a given curve.  Dr. Geo is Modify-me Ready! But don't be afraid, if you only want to design interactive sketch, Dr. Geo is intuitive and easy to use.![](file:///web/files/success/2014-06-DrGeo-script.png width=800px)_Programming in Pharo is addictive, fun and fast_ \(H.
