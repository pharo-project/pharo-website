title: User Interface and Interaction Prototyping for Defenselayout: blogpostpublishDate: "2022-03-04"Thales Defense Mission System France team is a Thales Business Unit that is responsible for prototyping UI and Interaction of large projects for the national french defense. The following video \([https://files-debugging.inria.fr/?dir=Science-Talks/Hot-Debugging-Defense-Industry](https://files-debugging.inria.fr/?dir=Science-Talks/Hot-Debugging-Defense-Industry)\) shows a real simulation setup with a flight team performing surveillance tasks. The simulation lasts a full day and the Thales team is monitoring and debugging live the prototypes that they are validating with the simulation. Pharo and Smalltalk flexibility \(on the fly stack reification, serialization\) and hot update capabibilities are key for the team.  ![](http://files.pharo.org/success-stories/images/2022-02-22-Thales.png width=600px)
