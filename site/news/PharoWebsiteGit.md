In 2022, we moved the Pharo Website to a new setup: it is now generated from static files (still using Pharo)


This means that you can now:
- Submit issues if you find typos or have suggestions
- Do PRs to suggest news entries ([this entry started as a PR](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-site/pull/18))
- update links that are out of date

all via github: add an issue, do Pull Requests:
