title: [ANN] PharoCloud focuses on Ephemeric Cloudlayout: blogpostpublishDate: "2017-06-13"Mike announced some news about [http://pharocloud.com](http://pharocloud.com):PharoCloud is not closing, but just dropping VM hosting support. We willcontinue to develop and maintain Ephemeric Cloud which allows you to publishPharo web applications online much easier than any other VM hosting canoffer. In some way PharoCloud just becomes more "cloudy" by droppingoutdated technologies off :\)Our plan is to make the project more community oriented. We integratedPharoCloud with [https://association.pharo.org](https://association.pharo.org) SSO and provide **FREE** access to all **Pharo
Association** members. You are welcome to log in to the cloud with your PharoAssociation account at:[https://www.pharocloud.com/manager/connect](https://www.pharocloud.com/manager/connect)We are encouraging you to migrate your applications hosted as Pharocloud VMsto the Ephemeric Cloud. It is much more simple! We have some positiveexperience already. There are some examples I moved from VM hosting toEphemeric Cloud:- [http://pharo.pharocloud.com](http://pharo.pharocloud.com)- [http://seaside31.swarm.pharocloud.com](http://seaside31.swarm.pharocloud.com)- [http://eph-b147b6e2.swarm.pharocloud.com](http://eph-b147b6e2.swarm.pharocloud.com)- [http://smalltalk.mikefilonov.ru](http://smalltalk.mikefilonov.ru)Here you can find a quick start guide to Ephemeric cloud and some tips onhow to publish your app:[http://docs.swarm.pharocloud.com/article/getting\_started](http://docs.swarm.pharocloud.com/article/getting_started)Also there is a REST API you can use to manage the cloud. And there is alsoa Pharo wrapper around the REST-API:[http://docs.swarm.pharocloud.com/article/pharo\_library\_reference](http://docs.swarm.pharocloud.com/article/pharo_library_reference)We also have video guides:quickstart \(sorry for old UI of the manager\)- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1GfuT9M4qo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1GfuT9M4qo)- curl example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dKBCpj96cU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dKBCpj96cU)
