title: [Wanted] Companies using Pharo
layout: blogpost
publishDate: "2025-08-27"


We have a list of Pharo Companies at [https://pharo.org/Companies](https://pharo.org/Companies).

A problem of course was that the list got out of date quite quickly.

We now have improved it:

- there is a form to add a new company
- the contact person will get a link to update the infos at any time
- the system sends a mail every year to the contact to remind to check if the data is still current
- website is rendered directly from the data
	
The current page still has a simple rendering: all companies alphabetically.
But with the data we will be able to improve this step by step, so consider adding the info not currently used (e.g. map position, logo...)

Future:

- nicer page, e.g. with company logos
- check links regularly (and send mail in case it is broken)
- interactive map
	
For now, the page contains both the new and the old list, with the idea of removing the old entries eventually.

If you are on the ESUG Mailinglist, you might have seen that there is thesame for ESUG, for Smalltalk in general.
The link to add your company there is [https://esug.org/companies.html](https://esug.org/companies.html).
