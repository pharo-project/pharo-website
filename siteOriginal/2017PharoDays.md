Ducasse\)_Summary_ Pharo 70 will focus on stabilisation of a new process where Pharo source code will be stored in Git. It will see the use in production of the pharo bootstrap. Still new features are lurking at the start of Pharo 70. The new code pluggable browser, named Calypso \(a famous explorer boat\) will replace Nautilus. Calypso is able to browse remote system, ring metamodel. With Calypso will come also a command frameworks to be used everywhere in the system. We will take the opportunity of this talk to get feedback from the community in terms of missing features or parts of the system that deserve more love. #### Robotic Exploration and Mapping with Pharo \(N. Bouraqadi,  J. Dichtl, L. Fabresse, and G. Lozenguez from IMT Douai\)_Summary_Indoor robot operations require robots to explore buildings and map them by themselves.This task is a prerequisite to any application such as packet transportation in a warehouse, guiding people in a museum, or delivering drugs and blood samples in a hospital.The challenge of robotic mapping inside a building is that GPS signals are unavailable.Therefore, robots rely on embedded sensors such as laser range sensors, to localize, as well as discover and map the environment.In this talk, we present  our ongoing effort to build end to end Pharo-based robotic applications.This involves using Pharo for writing both robot drivers as well as code that perform heaving computations related to robotic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping \(SLAM\).We also discuss challenges we face including compliance with the existing de facto standard middleware ROS, testing, and obviously performance.#### Bridging Seaside and ReactJS \(Johan Brichau. 2Rivers\)#### Iceberg: Git with Pace in Pharo \(E. Lorenzano\)#### Raspberry and Arduino are Getting Live with Pharo  \(D. Kudriashov and M. Denker\)_Summary_ The traditional way of handling raspberry is to compile and deploy via ssh. Then when the code does not work, we should add trace recompile and redeploy. This talk will show how to manage RapberryPi device with Pharo using remote development tools.#### gt4gemstone: molding objects with moldable tools in GemStone and Pharo by Andrei Chis_Summary_ gt4gemstone is a version of the Glamorous Toolkit aimed at supporting remote development with GemStone/S. The aim of gt4gemstone is to enable rapid customisation of development tools. Currently gt4gemStone makes it possible to express most custom views for GTInspector exactly in the same way both in Pharo and in GemStone. With the ability of having the same code working both in Pharo and in GemStone, the scenario of building in Pharo and deploying in GemStone is even more appealing \([http://www.humane-assessment.com/blog/introducing-gt4gemstone](http://www.humane-assessment.com/blog/introducing-gt4gemstone)\).#### Xmpp by Philippe Back_Summary_ XmppTalk is an XmppClient that uses LibStrophe as its XMPP communication library. LibStrophe provides encryption support.XmppTalk provides the ability to declare and write Stanza handlers in Pharo. This enables the developer to easily debug communication using the powerful Pharo debugging infrastructure and the XmppLogEvent inspired from the ZnLogEvent which makes the XMPP events easily inspectable in GTInspector. This translates into an ability to implement XEPs \(XMPP Extension Protocols\) easily. With XmppTalk, a Pharo developer can create custom XMPP clients for all kinds of purposes. It is worth noticing that WhatsApp and the US Military uses similar technology for their instant messenging needs. A set of XEPs are already implemented in XmppTalk. The intended use is to make it easy to create clients that can talk to each other, possibly supporting specific XEPs for business purposes \(exchanges of contract, stock, presence, signature information\) in real time and in a scalable manner.#### Jira API Automator, Jira Backup Explorer, Zephyr Test Explorer, Cross Reports Generator and Web frontend by Philippe Back_Summary_These are tools to extract and process date from the Jira agile issue tracking tool as well as from the Zephyr testing add on: They allow one to have a historical view of the activities of the team using Jira snapshots, produce contextual reports and help with tracking team activities at the budget level.Used technologies: Pharo, XMLPullParser, Zinc, REST, GTInspector custom presentations, Announcers, Spec, Seaside, Material Design Lite, TaskIt2, ProcessWrapper, GTSpotter, Microsoft Azure, Windows Server 2012 R2, NSSM, Thinfinity Client#### Calypso: a new tool suite for Pharo 70 \(D. Kudriashov\)**Summary** Calypso project provides alternative tool set for browsing images. It implements system and method browsers based on new navigation model which is optimised for remote development. This talk will demonstrate current functionality of Calypso and will show with examples how to extend it. Calypso is extensible and it will replace Nautilus in Pharo 70.#### Material Design Light for Seaside by Cyril Ferlicot_Summary_Material Design guidelines defines a visual language for users thatsynthesizes the classic principles of good design. This specificationdeveloped by Google offer an alternative to the front-end frameworkTwitter Bootstrap.In Material Design Lite for Seaside we offer simple web componentsfollowing Material Design's guidelines for the visual aspect. We alsobuild more complex widgets to ease the development of web applications.#### Understanding Rewrite Expressions by T. Goubier and J. Lecerf#### Sista:PharoVM performance \(C. Béra\)_Summary_ This talk summarises recent performance improvements in the Pharo VM, including GC and code execution speed-up. Then, short-term future work is discussed, with early results and integration status._Bio_ After working during 5 years on different aspects of the Pharo runtime as an engineer then as a PhD student, Clement is now finishing his PhD and is about to work on various evolutions of the Pharo virtual machine.#### 64 bits \(C. Béra/E. Lorenzano\) #### Blockchain Analysis with Pharo \(S. Bragagnolo\)#### PharoJS: Develop in Pharo, Run on Javascript \(N. Bouraqadi\)_Summary_ Pharo code available on repo: [http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/\~noury/PharoJS](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~noury/PharoJS)Doc available at: [http://pharojs.org/](http://pharojs.org/)## How to Reach usThe conference will happen at Inria Lille Nord Europe [http://www.inria.fr/lille](http://www.inria.fr/lille).```40 avenue de Halley
