## Donate

The Pharo infrastructure \(e.g. Servers\) needs money to operate. In addition, with funds collected by the Pharo Association, we are supporting important development efforts that push Pharo forward. You can give using [Paypal](https://pharo.wildapricot.org/Donate). For recurring contributions, you can join the [Association](http://association.pharo.org) or the [Consortium](http://consortium.pharo.org).

## Pharo and MIT vs. Pharo and GPL

You might be curious about why Pharo uses the MIT license and why we steer clear of GPL licenses or other similar types. For more details, you can visit [this place](http://etoileos.com/dev/licensing/).  
Essentially, the GPL licenses pose challenges for systems where code and libraries are managed as objects within shared memory spaces. This structure implies that integrating GPL code into your system would necessitate converting the entire system to GPL, thereby obliging you to release your work under the GPL as well.  
While this explanation may not capture all the nuances, please understand why Pharo is committed to the MIT license and, as such, why we cannot accept contributions licensed differently.

## For companies and legal entities, the [consortium](http://consortium.pharo.org/)


Companies can join the consortium.  The goal is to build an umbrella structure to foster sustainable business around Pharo. By becoming a consortium member you help promote Pharo, and support the day to day development of Pharo. Remember that having a strong open-source language is important. 

Pharo consortium members also get professional support. 

Research institutes, Universities and teaching structures can also join the consortium as Pharo Academic Partners.

## For individuals, the [association](http://association.pharo.org)


The Pharo association's goal is to let individuals support the promotion and development of Pharo. The association is a Loi de 1901 french non-profit organisation. The idea behind the association is that even a single person can make an impact when we group together.
