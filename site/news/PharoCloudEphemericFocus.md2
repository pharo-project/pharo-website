Mike announced some news about [http://pharocloud.com](http://pharocloud.com):

PharoCloud is not closing, but just dropping VM hosting support. We will
continue to develop and maintain Ephemeric Cloud which allows you to publish
Pharo web applications online much easier than any other VM hosting can
offer. In some way PharoCloud just becomes more "cloudy" by dropping
outdated technologies off :\)

Our plan is to make the project more community oriented. We integrated
PharoCloud with [https://association.pharo.org](https://association.pharo.org) SSO and provide **FREE** access to all **Pharo

Association** members. You are welcome to log in to the cloud with your Pharo
Association account at:

[https://www.pharocloud.com/manager/connect](https://www.pharocloud.com/manager/connect)

We are encouraging you to migrate your applications hosted as Pharocloud VMs
to the Ephemeric Cloud. It is much more simple! We have some positive
experience already. There are some examples I moved from VM hosting to
Ephemeric Cloud:

Here you can find a quick start guide to Ephemeric cloud and some tips on
how to publish your app:

Also there is a REST API you can use to manage the cloud. And there is also
a Pharo wrapper around the REST-API:

We also have video guides:
