Before being able to run Pharo Launcher, you may need to update temporarily your security settings: if you have Mac OS X 10.8 or higher then you might get a message saying that Pharo "can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer". This is due to the OS X Gatekeeper feature that is designed to discourage users from downloading from random locations and possibly installing something bad. Assuming you've downloaded Pharo Launcher from Pharo web site, then you have nothing to worry about, and you just need to bypass this warning:  - Recommended - Right click \(or command+click\) the application icon and select "open"  - Advanced - Enable all application downloads    - In OS X go to the Apple Menu -> System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General ->    - Unlock the padlock at the bottom of the window, which will require a computer admin password    - Where it says "Allow applications downloaded from:" select "Anywhere"    - OS X will give you a scary warning that is a bit exaggerated. If you're not comfortable with this, use the "right click" method mentioned above. In all cases OS X will still ask you if you want to open an "unsigned" application the first time it is opened, so new applications that are downloaded can't just start by themselves.- Windows: Run the installer and follow instructions. Be sure to install Pharo Launcher in a place where you have write privileges.- GNU/Linux: Unzip the archive in a place where you have write privileges.**Usage**Run Pharo Launcher. Initially on a new computer the right side with local images is empty. On the left side are the template images that are available on the web. Select the template image you like and download it. For instance you can download "Official distributions" -> "Pharo 6.1 \(stable\)" which is the latest stable image as of today. The launcher will download the image into a specific directory somewhere in your users home directory \(you can configure where by clicking the Settings button at the bottom of the window\). Each image gets its own folder. Use the "Show in folder" menu item if you want to open this location.After download you can "Launch" the image from the context menu in the right list. This will open the new image and close the launcher image. So you are ready to start working.More documentation is available at [https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-launcher/](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-launcher/).You can use Pharo development image: Pharo 7 if you want to contribute to Pharo or you can’t wait to discover / use new Pharo features.# Pharo standaloneYou can download Pharo as a single application.- [Pharo 6.1 for macOS \(32bit\)](http://files.pharo.org/platform/Pharo6.1-mac.zip) \([sha](http://files.pharo.org/platform/Pharo6.1-mac.zip.sha256.txt)\)- [Pharo 6.1 for macOS \(64bit\)](http://files.pharo.org/platform/Pharo6.1-64-mac.zip) \([sha](http://files.pharo.org/platform/Pharo6.1-64-mac.zip.sha256.txt)\)- [Pharo 6.1 for Windows \(32bit\)](http://files.pharo.org/platform/Pharo6.1-win.zip) \([sha](http://files.pharo.org/platform/Pharo6.1-win.zip.sha256.txt)\)- [Pharo 6.1 for GNU/Linux \(32bit\)](http://files.pharo.org/platform/Pharo6.1-linux.zip) \([sha](http://files.pharo.org/platform/Pharo6.1-linux.zip.sha256.txt)\)- [Pharo 6.1 for GNU/Linux \(64bit\)](http://files.pharo.org/platform/Pharo6.1-64-linux.zip) \([sha](http://files.pharo.org/platform/Pharo6.1-64-linux.zip.sha256.txt)\)## Linux PackagesPackages are available for some common linux distributions The binary names are picked to allow to install the 32bit and 64bit VM in parallel.
