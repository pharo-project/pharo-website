title: Pharo 7.0 releasedlayout: blogpostpublishDate: "2019-01-22"Dear World and dynamic language lovers: The time has come for [Pharo 7.0](http://pharo.org)!**Pharo is a pure object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment, focused on simplicity and immediate feedback.**![](http://files.pharo.org/success-stories/images/Pharo7.0-800x500.png width=800px)This is our most significant release yet. Here are the key highlights of this release:- Pharo is now provided in 64-bit version in Linux and OSX and brings even better performance and stability. The 64-bit version is now recommended for Linux and Mac, and is provided as technical preview for Windows.- Pharo comes with a new version of the PharoLauncher \(https://pharo.org/download\): THE tool to manage your distributions \(access to regular versions, jenkins builds, and older versions\). - Pharo build has a fully new build process that supports its full bootstrap from sources. This will enable the production to specific \(micro\) images. - Iceberg, the git client for Pharo has been significantly improved, and is the default VCS.- Calypso, the angular stone of PharoThings, is the new system Pharo browser. It replaces Nautilus and brings better remote working and more advanced browsing capabilities. - IoT is now an important part of Pharo. Installing PharoThings \(https://github.com/pharo-iot/PharoThings\) provides an impressive amount of tools to develop applications in small devices.- The unified foreign function interface \(UnifiedFFI\) for interfacing with the outside world is significantly improved to work properly on Windows 64-bit._Pharo 70’s new infrastructure and process set the stage for a new generation of version. 

The visibility of GitHub combined with the powerful tools that have been validated with more than one year of beta testing is massively pay off._These are just the more prominent highlights, but the details are just as important. We have closed a massive amount of issues: **2142 issues!** \(A comprehensive ChangeLog can be found [here](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-changelogs/blob/master/Pharo70ChangeLogs.md)\).While the technical improvements are significant, still the most impressive fact is that the new code that got in the main Pharo 7.0 image was contributed by **more than 75 people**.Pharo is more than code. It is an exciting project involving energetic people.
