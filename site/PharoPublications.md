We are collecting all scientific literature that involves Pharo in some way. Both publications about Pharo or those using Pharo are ok.

[https://hal.inria.fr/PHARO](https://hal.inria.fr/PHARO)

How do I add more papers?

The HAL platform is open to everyone. See [https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr)
- create an account
- start submission by clicking submit. You are asked for all information / the PDF of your paper.
- In the META Data: add “PHARO” in the field “Collaboration/Project”.


After the paper is validated, it will show up in the PHARO collection around one day later.

If your paper is already in HAL: just modify the meta data and add  “PHARO” in the field “Collaboration/Project”.
