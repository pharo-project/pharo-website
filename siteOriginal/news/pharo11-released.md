Dear Pharo users and dynamic language lovers: 

We have released [Pharo](https://pharo.org/) version 11!

## What is Pharo?

Pharo is a pure object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment focused on simplicity and immediate feedback.

- Simple & powerful language: No constructors, no types declaration, no interfaces, no primitive types. Yet a powerful and elegant language with a full syntax fitting in one postcard! Pharo is objects and messages all the way down.

- Live, immersive environment: Immediate feedback at any moment of your development: Developing, testing, debugging. Even in production environments, you will never be stuck in compiling and deploying steps again!

- Amazing debugging experience: Pharo environment includes a debugger unlike anything you've seen before. It allows you to step through code, restart the execution of methods, create methods on the fly, and much more!

- Pharo is yours: Pharo is made by an incredible community, with more than 100 contributors for the last revision of the platform and hundreds of people constantly contributing with frameworks and libraries.

- Fully open-source: Pharo full stack is released under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) License and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo)
