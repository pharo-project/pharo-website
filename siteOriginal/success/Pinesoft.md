Post-ID supports scanning addresses and information about postal items efficiently. MBagger is a standalone product to copy address labels quickly and efficiently, offering a 100% return on investment typically within 100 hours of use. Both are based on the Pinesoft toolkit. _We have worked with Pinesoft over several years and it helps that they are familiar with our business as well as our technology requirements. _Paul Taylor, CEO, Swiss Post![](file:///web/files/success/2014-11-03-PostItModularisedArchitecture.png width=600px)The Pinesoft toolkit has a modular architecture, where each module, referred to as a processor, represents a different part of a process flow. Unique applications are created by selecting a collection of processors, configuring how each processor behaves, and deciding how the selected output or selection of outputs of a processor  are mapped, \(“wired”\), to the selected input\(s\) of another or other connected processor\(s\).
