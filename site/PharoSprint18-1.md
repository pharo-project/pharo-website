We organise one Pharo “Sprint” per month were we meet to work on boring issue tracker entries together.

Goals of the next sprints:

- Fix issues for Pharo7
- Backport important fixes to Pharo6
- Clean issue tracker to prepare for release Pharo7


Remotely, you can join us on Discord. During the sprint, we will try to synchronize local and remote Pharo sprinters. In the past people organised local sprints at the same time \(e.g. Santiago/Chile\).
