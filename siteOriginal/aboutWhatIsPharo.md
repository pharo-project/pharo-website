# What is to deliver Pharo?

You probably know what Pharo is, but the interesting next questions are:
- what are the components that compose Pharo?
- what does it mean to deliver Pharo?
- what are the elements that should be maintained to make sure that Pharo is running?  

We present a digestible list of elements to answer these questions. 
It is in no way exhaustive.
