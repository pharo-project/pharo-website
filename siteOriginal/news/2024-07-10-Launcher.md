Pharo Launcher 3.2 has just been released! It is available from [http://pharo.org/download](http://pharo.org/download).

Pharo Launcher now comes with a command-line version that you can use from a terminal!
You can check the [documentation of commands](https://pharo-project.github.io/pharo-launcher/commands-cmd-line/)  as well as instructions to [make pharo-launcher available](https://pharo-project.github.io/pharo-launcher/installation/) on the command line.

This nice feature is now available thanks to the contributions of Axel Marlard, David Bajger and I as well as the support of Damien Pollet for the Clap library.

## New Features

### Command Line Support
- All commands available in the UI version of Pharo Launcher are supported
- New commands:
  - Create an image from a Pull Request number (from Pharo repository)
  - Create an image from a build number, a SHA
  - Create an image and import your code from a repository
  - Share easily an image (zip file with the Pharo image, the VM to run it and a launch script)
  - Find easily the Pharo version where a bug was introduced with image bisect algorithm
  - Launch an image with a script
  - List running Pharo processes
- When creating an image, the image is now launched automatically

### Improvements
- CI Moved to Github Actions
- Better Mac OS system menu
- Do not try to guess the version of a Pharo image if information is not available but rather ask the user
- When deleting more than one image at a time the message is not clear (#594)

### Bug Fixes

- Use "Show" when no image is downloaded yet gives error (#570) (thanks to @astares)
- Development mode does not close pharoLauncher application (#548)
- Using "Show in folder" gives DNU (#568) (thanks to @astares)
- Launcher cannot launch Pharo-4.0 image (#585)
