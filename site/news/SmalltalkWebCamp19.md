This is an un-conference: everyone is invited to actively participate by presenting their project. Come and share your web development experience with Smalltalk.

Wether you are doing Seaside, Teapot, PharoJS, Amber, SqueakJs, Zinc REST, … or anything else that involves Smalltalk and web technologies: come and share your experience!

We provide ample time to discuss and collaborate on topics, meet people and have a beer in the evening.

Attendance is free, but please register before October 15th if you are attending, so we can plan accordingly.
