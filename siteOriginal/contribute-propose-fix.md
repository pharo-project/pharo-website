## How to propose a bug fix or enhancement

First check if your change has already been entered into the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo/issues), and consider watching the [overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90T0OSb_Fuo) of the steps documented below. 

Pharo is managed with git and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo) 
To submit a fix:
- make sure that you use the latest image
- do a Pull Request in the development branch. For a full description, see [here](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo/wiki/Contribute-a-fix-to-Pharo).

You can also contribute to Pharo by proposing enhancements following the same process.

### CI checking your submission

The fix then will be checked by an automated tool \(the CI Server\).
