title: openPonklayout: blogpostpublishDate: "2019-04-05"OpenPonk is an open conceptual modelling platform. It started as an experimental project exploring a possiblity to complement Eclipse EMF and GMF by a more concise, comprehensible and expressive alternative. The hypothesis was that it can be achieved by leveraging Pharo's straight-forward dynamic purely object-oriented language instead of Java's torpour and ceremony.OpenPonk leverages Roassal \(specifically Trachel\) and it has become a solid foundation for conceptual modelling and diagramming projects, such as an multi-agent modelling for CIRAD or Normalized Systems Modeller.The most versatile part of OpenPonk is currently probably a complete UMLbootstrap from OMG specification, however its aim is to be a powerfulpartner for any conceptual modelling endeavours, be it model-driven softwareengineering, enterprise engineering or other engineering disciplines dealing withcomplex models and diagrams."OpenPonk is a realisation of my dreams of a platform, in whichresearchers, students of all levels and practicioners in their daily work can easily materialise their thoughts, without reinventing the wheel" explains theproject lead, Dr. Robert Pergl, Head of the Centre for Conceptual Modelling andImplementation at the Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague.![](http://files.pharo.org/success-stories/images/2018-OpenPonk.png width=800px)
