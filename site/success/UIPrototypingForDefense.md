The following video \([https://files-debugging.inria.fr/?dir=Science-Talks/Hot-Debugging-Defense-Industry](https://files-debugging.inria.fr/?dir=Science-Talks/Hot-Debugging-Defense-Industry)\) shows a real simulation setup with a flight team performing surveillance tasks. The simulation lasts a full day and the Thales team is monitoring and debugging live the prototypes that they are validating with the simulation. Pharo and Smalltalk flexibility \(on-the-fly stack reification, serialization\) and hot update capabilities are key for the team.  ![](http://files.pharo.org/success-stories/images/2022-02-22-Thales.png width=600px)
