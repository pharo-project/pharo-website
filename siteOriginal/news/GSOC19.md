title: [ANN] Google Summer of Code 2019layout: blogpostpublishDate: "2019-02-28"The Pharo Consortium has been selected this year as a Google Summer of Code 2019 mentor organization. This is the first time since 2017.I would like to thank other GSOC co-admin Jigyasa Grover and Oleksandr Zaytsev for their commitment and hard work, Peter Uhnak for his help for the website, Alexandre Bergel, Yuriy Tymchuk, Serge Stinckwich and St√©phane Ducasse for their interactions.We will prepare the call for students soon. We have already a website with a list of subject: [http://gsoc.pharo.org/](http://gsoc.pharo.org/)More subjects can be added, but we will focus on topics that will have the bigger impact on the Pharo community.We will use the #gsoc-planning channel on Discord to discuss.If you have students that might be interested, please let them know about this opportunity. There is #gsoc-students channel for them.
