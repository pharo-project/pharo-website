A while back our team presented Quuve \[1\], a customizable investment management ecosystem for professional investors. We also discussed the technologies employed to build it \[2\] \(it is developed on Pharo and deployed on GemStone\). We are reaching out again because we recently revamped our website \[3\] and created a number of promotional videos that demonstrate Quuve's power \[4\]. We would appreciate your help in marketing our wares!

Quuve is the world's first fully integrated and customizable research and portfolio management platform. The system offers powerful features never before seen by the investment community and it empowers users to tailor tools in ways that accommodate their idiosyncratic investment style. In the coming years, customization, data-inheritance, shared databases, machine-learning, and robo-trading will become standard among investors of all sizes, and we expect Quuve will blaze the trail.

If you have any questions about Quuve please let us know.
