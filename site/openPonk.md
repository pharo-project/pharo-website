It started as an experimental project exploring a possiblity of complementing Eclipse EMF and GMF by a more concise, comprehensible and expressive alternative. The hypothesis was that it could be achieved by leveraging Pharo's straightforward dynamic purely object-oriented language instead of Java's torpor and ceremony.OpenPonk leverages Roassal \(specifically Trachel\) and it has become a solid foundation for conceptual modeling and diagramming projects, such as an multi-agent modeling for CIRAD or Normalized Systems Modeller.The most versatile part of OpenPonk is currently probably a complete UMLbootstrap from OMG specification, however, its aim is to be a powerfulpartner for any conceptual modeling endeavors, be it model-driven softwareengineering, enterprise engineering or other engineering disciplines dealing withcomplex models and diagrams."OpenPonk is a realization of my dreams of a platform, in whichresearchers, students of all levels and practitioners in their daily work can easily materialize their thoughts, without reinventing the wheel" explains the project lead, Dr. Robert Pergl, Head of the Centre for Conceptual Modelling andImplementation at the Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague.![](http://files.pharo.org/success-stories/images/2018-OpenPonk.png width=800px)
