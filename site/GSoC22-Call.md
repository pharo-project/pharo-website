Hello to all,

We, as the Pharo organization, are applying to the Google Summer of Code \(GSoC\) 2022 version. 

From GSoC Page: "Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open-source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors." More info: [https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)

Now we are preparing to postulate. We would like to have the most projects as possible. Like that, we will contribute to Pharo and to Open Source in general.

If you have any project and you are willing to be a mentor please send us your proposal! We would be happy to work with you.

The email address is: gsoc-admin@pharo.org

Yours sincerely,

Sebastian Jordan, GSoC Program Organizer from Pharo Consortium
