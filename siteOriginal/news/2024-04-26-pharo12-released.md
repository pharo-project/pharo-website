Dear Pharo users and dynamic language lovers: 

We have released [Pharo](https://pharo.org/) version 12!

## What is Pharo?

Pharo is a pure object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment focused on simplicity and immediate feedback.

- Simple & powerful language: No constructors, no types declaration, no interfaces, no primitive types. Yet a powerful and elegant language with a full syntax fitting in one postcard! Pharo is objects and messages all the way down.

- Live, immersive environment: Immediate feedback at any moment of your development: Developing, testing, debugging. Even in production environments, you will never be stuck in compiling and deploying steps again!

- Amazing debugging experience: Pharo environment includes a debugger unlike anything you've seen before. It allows you to step through code, restart the execution of methods, create methods on the fly, and much more!

- Pharo is yours: Pharo is made by an incredible community, with more than 100 contributors for the last revision of the platform and hundreds of people constantly contributing with frameworks and libraries.

- Fully open-source: Pharo full stack is released under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) License and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo)
... more on the [Pharo Features page](http://www.pharo.org/features).

In this iteration of Pharo, we continue working on our objectives of improvement, clean-up and modularization.
Also, we included a number of usability and speed improvements. 
A complete list of changes and improvements is available in our [Changelog](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-changelogs/blob/master/Pharo120ChangeLogs.md)

Some highlights of this amazing version:

## Highlights

### New breakpoint system

The debug point system is a breakpoint model that supersedes the previous implementation of breakpoints and watchpoints. They are configurable, composable, and extensible. The traditional breakpoints remain available, including conditional breakpoints, one-time breakpoints, and object-centric breakpoints. Additionally, there are new types of breakpoints, such as chained-breakpoints, which condition the activation of certain breakpoints on the triggering of others (e.g., breakpoint B only activates if breakpoint A is hit first). Debug points also feature a dedicated browser and integration options.
