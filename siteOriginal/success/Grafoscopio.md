title: Grafoscopiolayout: blogpostpublishDate: "2018-05-04"![](http://files.pharo.org/success-stories/images//2018-Grafoscopio-1.png width=800px)Grafoscopio [Grafoscopio](http://mutabit.com/grafoscopio/index.en.html) is a moldable and versatile tool for literate computing that allowsone to mix prose, data, code, visualizations into interactive reproducible documents,raging from single notebooks to complete books.Using Grafoscopio, [Data Week](http://mutabit.com/dataweek/) is a recurrent workshop+hackathon, where participants learn how touse, adapt and modify Grafoscopio, to create their data narratives and customagile visualization and to create and open their own reproducible publications.With these tools and practices, we are amplifying diverse voices about citizenconcerns, crossing three themes: a\) governance and autonomy, b\) technology andinformation and c\) power entanglements.Some examples of what we have done with Grafoscopio are:- [Grafoscopio User Manual](http://mutabit.com/grafoscopio/index.en.html).- [Panama Papers as reproducible research](http://mutabit.com/offray/blog/en/entry/panama-papers-1).- [Data Driven Journalism Handbook \(Spanish\)](http://mutabit.com/repos.fossil/mapeda/)- [Steps towards a Digital Library in Bogot√° \(Spanish\)](http://mutabit.com/repos.fossil/dataweek/doc/tip/Artefactos/BibliotecaDigitalBogota/intro.md).- [Analysis of the Colombian Public Code Portal \(Spanish\)](http://mutabit.com/repos.fossil/dataweek/doc/tip/Artefactos/SoftwarePublicoColombia/intro.md).Pharo and its ecosystem, and the proactive and helpful communities around them, have been key in this experience, by providing a moldable base to create ourown tools within a unified, extensible, interactive live coding and modelingenvironment, including the[Roassal agile visualization engine](http://agilevisualization.com/) and the [GT Tools](http://gtoolkit.org/)Thanks to those tools and communities, we are able to move in a pretty agile wayand to have a leverage point where we can work with a unified metaphor to approacha diversity of themes \(like those linked above\) and tools, from documentationformats and publication \(Pandoc, Markdown, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, EPUB\), to data modelling,retrieval, storage and serialization \(JSON, STON, SQL, Fossil\), to custom agilevisualization.Such simple and powerful immersive integrated environment, that is wellconnected with the external world and helps the community to create its own tools,have proven to be key in developing the new devices, literacies and practices,that a world, where the intertwine between digital technologies, citizenship andpower plays an increasingly central role, is urgently needing.
