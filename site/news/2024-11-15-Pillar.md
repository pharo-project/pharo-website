[Release Notes](https://github.com/pillar-markup/pillar/releases/tag/v10.4.1)

- Uses Microdown V2.7.1: introduces new elements to support Foliage and web generation. It improves the document checker. Now the following analyses are reported: duplicated anchors, references to unexisting anchors, unreferenced figures, missing figure files, and missing input files.
