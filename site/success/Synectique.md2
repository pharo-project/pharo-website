Specifically, Moose with its software analysis engines for parser, meta-models for software artifacts, browsers, and visualizations make it possible to propose adapted and customized solutions. The technologies in Pharo provide excellent leverage to prototype a software analysis solution for a new language from the ground up in a matter of a few weeks. Once software information identified and represented, award-winning technologies in Pharo provide vehicles to express user interfaces, which show pertinent information for decision-making. From the language point of view, pure object-orientation, testing frameworks, full-stack debugger, object inspector, reflection facilities, and other innovative features make it first choice development platform for developer productivity and quality software development."_ - Synectique CTO, Usman Bhatti![](file:///web/files/success/2014-07-10-Synectique-Logo.png)
