The user with RMapViewer can search for particular isomers that match against several chemical structural descriptors, such as \(1\) SMILES, \(2\) InChI, and \(3\) CAST, as well as \(4\) topological chemical structures, locate the pathways between two or more isomers specified as a reaction reactant and a product and animate the motion of a molecular change via chemical reaction along its reaction pathway. RMapViewer has been developed with the support of the "Maizo"-chemistry project \([https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jccj/14/3/14\_2015-0048/\_html/-char/en](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jccj/14/3/14_2015-0048/_html/-char/en)\).![](http://files.pharo.org/success-stories/images/RMapViewer.png width=800px)
