## The Challenge: A Strategic Endeavor

Over the course of five years, Berger-Levrault's dedicated team embarked on a strategic journey to prepare for the migration of their applications. The objective was clear: a seamless transition to new standards while minimizing disruption. In response to this complex undertaking, Casino was bornâ€”a sophisticated tool meticulously crafted on top of the Moose software analysis platform and Pharo. It became the linchpin of their migration strategy.

Casino emerged as a powerful solution, leveraging the capabilities of the Moose software analysis platform for in-depth code understanding. The migration process was meticulously divided into four key stages:

1. **Source Code Analysis:**
   - Casino employed robust parsing techniques on the Moose platform to analyze the source code, creating a detailed Application Model.

2. **Selective Element Extraction:**
   - Focusing on crucial elements such as visual, behavioral, and business code, Casino, built on Pharo, extracted only the relevant aspects from the original app's source code.

3. **Code Correlation:**
   - Casino, utilizing the Moose platform, constructed a comprehensive dictionary to correlate old and new code, ensuring a seamless transition for visual and business elements.

4. **Dynamic Code Generation:**
   - With the mapping established, Casino, powered by Pharo, dynamically generated code for the migrated app, empowering developers to inject their expertise and finesse into the process.

Casino wasn't merely a migration tool; it evolved into a versatile solution adaptable to various desktop and client/server applications.

As the migration project expanded, the team faced the challenge of internationalization file migration. Leveraging Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) principles within the Pharo environment, they developed a sophisticated tool that seamlessly transformed .properties files used by Java into the .json format employed by Angular. This showcased Casino's adaptability and versatility in addressing diverse tech challenges.
