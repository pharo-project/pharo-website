layout: blogpost
publishDate: "2023-03-03"

We have released a new version of the Pharo VM for Pharo 11. This VM is accessible right now from Zero-Conf, updating it in the Pharo Launcher or using the usual downloads (as described in [pharo.org/download](https://pharo.org/download)). OBS packages are still in work and will come later.

This is the new VM that will be stable for Pharo 11 release, it is also compatible with Pharo 10 images but it is not the default for Pharo 10.

It has a lot of changes and improvements, as it is the result of more than a year and a half of improvements, clean-ups, and bug fixes.
