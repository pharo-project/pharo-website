This Version fix a really nasty issue when changing the resolution of the monitors in Windows. Thanks so much to all the people who helped us to identify it and to provide workarounds and the final solution that depended on updating SDL.

It is a good moment to update your VMs from the launcher, if you are using zeroconf, it will arrive automatically, and if you use OBS packages, theyÂ are also updated.
This release applies to Pharo 11, 12, 13 and 14.Â 

Thank you so much to all the contributors and all the issue reporters!
