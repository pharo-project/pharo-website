# We are applying for GSoC (Google Summer of Code) this year (again)!  

**Info:** [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)  

## TL;DR  
Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an initiative for student/beginner coders to contribute to open-source projects.  
- Organizations propose projects (like us).  
- Google selects some organizations.  
- Participants apply for projects.  
- If selected, Google pays the student for their work and the organization for mentoring.  

To be selected, we need a **good list of ideas/projects** where external contributors can participate.  

Last year's ideas: [GSoC Pharo Ideas](https://gsoc.pharo.org/ideas).

## Mentor Responsibilities  
Mentors must be available to:  
- Respond to student applications.  
- Supervise the work (likely **weekly interactions**).  
- Itâ€™s better to have **2-4 mentors per idea** to ensure availability.
