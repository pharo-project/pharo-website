title: Phratchlayout: blogpostpublishDate: "2015-10-01"Phratch [http://www.phratch.com](http://www.phratch.com) is a visual programming language based on Scratch \(https://scratch.mit.edu/\) on top of Pharo. More than just an overlay, the goal of Phratch is to bring closer the visual blocks and the language. Phratch is highly extensible, which makes it easy to implement new blocks and new features. The main goal of Phratch is to become a robotics development environment for non-experts. It already works on top of the Lego Mindstorms using the JetStorm library and on the Robosoft Kompai.Phratch is based on Pharo because Pharo provides a lot of stable and innovative libraries. For example, the Fuel serializer is used for saving Phratch projects, the Metacello version manager is used to manage add-ons. Another thing that makes Pharo the best choice for Phratch is the community activity: as a developer, I am sure to have a great support when I have problems with a library. J.
