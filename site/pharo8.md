Dear World and dynamic language lovers:   

The time has come for Pharo 8.0!  

**Pharo is a pure object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment, focused on simplicity and immediate feedback.**

Here are the key highlights of this release:  

- The 64-bit version has become the recommended version for Windows as it was for Unix and OSX.
- Iceberg, the git client for Pharo, reached its version 1.6.5 with several improvements and bugfixes.
- Calypso, Pharo’s system browser has new and better refactoring integrations and AST-based suggestions for class definitions.
- The unified foreign function interface \(UnifiedFFI\) has been improved with more support for literal objects, better type coercions, and more documentation.
- Several speed improvements in code searches and compilation.


In addition, this version includes several previews of new tools such as the Spec2 GUI framework with native widget integration and the new DrTests test analysis tool and opens the door for the upcoming headless VMs for servers and non-blocking FFI.  

These are just the more prominent highlights, but the details are just as important. We have closed a massive amount of issues: **2805 issues**!   

A comprehensive changelog can be found at the [ChangeLogs](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-changelogs/blob/master/Pharo80ChangeLogs.md).  

While the technical improvements are significant, still the most impressive fact is that the new code that got in the main Pharo 8.0 image was contributed by more than 75 people.  

Pharo is more than code. It is an exciting project involving energetic people.
