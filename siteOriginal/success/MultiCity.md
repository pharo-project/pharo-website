title: MultiCitylayout: blogpostpublishDate: "2015-07-15"![](file:///web/files/success/2015-07-Multicity-ubersicht.png width=800px)The [Citroen Multicity](https://www.multicity-carsharing.de) partner platform was a system for geo-fence based marketing in the car rental market. It enabled companies to place shops and offers onto a city map to be advertized when customers are nearby. On occurrences like the return of a rental car the system will figure out nearby advertisements and will contact the customer via mobile phone to send an offer. Received messages can act as vouchers for the offer. ''Pharo has been very helpful in that project. The unique development experience made it possible to realize this project in a short time frame. The whole system of managing mobile devices, mobile messaging and geo advertisement is driven by the pharo runtime. Pharo is an integral part of development at 2Denker"  -- N.
