Once you start receiving applications, you invite evaluators to work on them. Finally, you choose the criteria to determine which applications pass to the next round\(s\) \(or win the contest\). You get immediate visibility of how the contest is progressing, identifying any hotspots you need to pay attention to.Currently, one of our key customers, BBVA's Innovation Center, is using Contestia to manage all the workflow details for the BBVA Open Talent 2017 \([https://www.centrodeinnovacionbbva.com/en/opentalent](https://www.centrodeinnovacionbbva.com/en/opentalent)\):_The world’s biggest fintech challenge for startups, which this year has grown significantly.

The core and other services are running Pharo 6 and are integrated with other microservices based on different stacks through asynchronous messaging using RabbitMQ and REST APIs._Pharo has been a key piece to successfully apply our Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach for Contestia development. We have developed a service following a hexagonal architecture and based on event sourcing and CQRS. Pharo provides an agile live development environment that allows us a very fast development pace and building a reliable and maintainable software system_ said R. Luque from OSOCO.es
