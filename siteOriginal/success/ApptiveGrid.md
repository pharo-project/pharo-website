On top of the data model a form creator turns your model into a form that you can send e.g. via email to inquire data from other people.

On the other hand ApptiveGrid is a workflow system where you can define your work flow in the web frontend and connect to events. These events are either internal (resulting from a change in your data model) or external where you can use web hooks to kick of work flows.

## About the tech stack

- The business backend of ApptiveGrid is 100% [Pharo](https://pharo.org)
- It uses [Zinc Components](https://github.com/svenvc/zinc) for the HTTP frontend
- and [Soil](https://github.com/ApptiveGrid/Soil) as the persistence solution.
- Each user has its own database (an empty soil database is 24kb on disk).
- one Pharo image holds multiple soil databases open and provides memory caching for the objects
- routing of requests is done with haproxy connection persistence
- the web frontend is made with Vue.js and a Pharo library that we transpile to JS with PharoJS
