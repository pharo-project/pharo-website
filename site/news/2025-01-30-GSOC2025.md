# We are applying for GSoC (Google Summer of Code) this year (again)!  

**Info:** [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)  

## TL;DR  
Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an initiative for student/beginner coders to contribute to open-source projects.  
- Organizations propose projects (like us).  
- Google selects some organizations.  
- Participants apply for projects.  
- If selected, Google pays the student for their work and the organization for mentoring.  

To be selected, we need a **good list of ideas/projects** where external contributors can participate.  

Last year's ideas: [GSoC Pharo Ideas](https://gsoc.pharo.org/ideas).

## Action Items  

### Please check:  
1. If you are a **supervisor** of an idea (use the filter) → Verify if it is still valid.  
2. If not, **think of a new idea**.

All changes (updates, deletions, or additions) must be made in this JSON file:  
[ideas.json](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-gsoc/blob/master/data/ideas.json).  

You can:  
- Submit a **Pull Request** with your changes: [pharo-gsoc repo](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-gsoc) 😉  
- Or send us the updated JSON, and we’ll push it 😖

## Mentor Responsibilities  
Mentors must be available to:  
- Respond to student applications.  
- Supervise the work (likely **weekly interactions**).  
- It’s better to have **2-4 mentors per idea** to ensure availability.
