On behalf of the community, I would like to thank each one of you for their significant contribution in the previously concluded Google Summer of Code 2017 with Pharo Consortium. We aspire to take-off on a long flight after this successful stint by applying to participate in the upcoming Google Summer of Code 2018.

As many of you might know, Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school. Read more about the program here:

[https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)

The deadline for organisations to apply is January 23, 2018 which is fast approaching. As an open source evangelist and a Pharo developer, I would like to invite all the experienced members to be a part of the "GSoC 2018 with Pharo Consortium" Team and mentor students. Propose fresh ideas for projects which shall help improve Pharo or volunteer to mentor any of theexisting one \(Listed here: [http://gsoc.pharo.org/](http://gsoc.pharo.org/)\). To add your own project idea to the list, visit [http://gsoc.pharo.org/#adding-a-proposal](http://gsoc.pharo.org/#adding-a-proposal)

Looking forward to an appreciable representation from the Pharo community.

Best regards, 

Jigyasa Grover, Pharo Consortium Org Admin
