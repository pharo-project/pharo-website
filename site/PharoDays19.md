Dear members of the Pharo community,


We are happy to announce that we will be organising Pharo Days this year, in Lille, France. This will be a two day event: Thursday April 4 & Friday April 5. The main venue will be the Amphitheatre of INRIA Lille - Nord Europe.

Each day will consist of a number of short 20 to 30 minutes tech talks in the morning, with a more free format in the afternoon: general hacking space, pair programming, demos, side meetings, tutorials, coding sprints, Q&A's, shows us your projects - real life human interaction. Of course, there will be social events as well.

Please join us to make this another successful edition, after Annecy \(FR\) 2011, Lille 2012, Bern \(CH\) & Lille 2013, Lille 2015, Namur \(BE\) 2016 and Lille 2017.

Mark your calendars, we will provide more details when they become available: [https://pharo.org/2019PharoDays](https://pharo.org/2019PharoDays)
