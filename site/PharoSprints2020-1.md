We organise one Pharo “Sprint” per month were we meet to work on boring issue tracker entries together.

Goals of the next sprints:

- Fix issues for Pharo8
- Backport important fixes to Pharo7


Remotely, you can join us on Discord. During the sprint, we will try to synchronize local and remote Pharo sprinters. In the past people organised local sprints at the same time \(e.g. Santiago/Chile\). See here for more infos: [http://pharo.org/contribute-events](http://pharo.org/contribute-events)

There will be an event on the association website for each sprint. The next dates are every month the last Friday of the month.
