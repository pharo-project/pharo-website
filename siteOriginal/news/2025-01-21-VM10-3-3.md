layout: blogpost
publishDate: "2025-01-21"

Weâ€™ve published a new VM release (v10.3.3) to be used with Pharo versions 10 through 13. 10.3.3 includes all changes in 10.3.2 (that was rolled back) plus several improvements.

## Highlights
- Improves the naming schema of built artifacts to differentiate releases from intermediate/nightly builds.
- Is built on the old file server (that we recovered!) to support compatibility with older GLibC versions.
- Builds and runs properly on newer Linux systems (we fixed a couple of linking and compilation issues with newer versions of GCC).
- Many improvements in the perm space.

Please find information about the build and versions in the [wiki](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-vm/wiki).
