Over the summer, we released two versions:

## 10.3.6

Thanks to @SabineM we have found a regression we had in the previous release in some situations when we were handling the socket events and in the event handler we have another blocking call; all these fixes are in Windows only. 

All the fixes are intenteded to improve the experience when having applications that have a lot of open idle sockets; so if it is your case you can profit from the new relase (Again, only in Windows).

## 10.3.7

This release has only a fix for Windows Sockets. It is a problem we have found with @SabineM after a lot of debugging. The problem was a heavy CPU usage when there were a lot of idle sockets.
