The Pharo Consortium is very happy to announce that [ApptiveGrid GmbH](https://www.apptivegrid.de) has joined the Consortium as a Bronze Member.


[ApptiveGrid](https://www.apptivegrid.de) is a SaaS tool to digitalize and automatize business processes.

ApptiveGrid is a visual database that lets you effortlessly create and modify your data models through a web frontend, seamlessly integrates with REST API for external access, and features a dynamic form creator for easy data collection. It's also a powerful workflow system, where you can design and automate your processes, responding to both internal changes and external triggers through web hooks.

The backend of ApptiveGrid is 100% Pharo: It uses [zinc](https://github.com/svenvc/zinc) components for the HTTP frontend and [soil](https://github.com/ApptiveGrid/Soil) as the persistence solution.
